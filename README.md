# To-Do-List
A To-Do list is a list of tasks we require to complete or things we would like to do.

Most typically, the tasks in this list are arranged in order of priority. By tradition, they are written on a piece of paper or post-it notes and act as a memory aid. Due to the evolution in technology, we have been able to create a To-Do lists with Excel Spreadsheets, Word Documents, E-mail Lists, and To-Do List applications like Microsoft to-do and Google to-do lists. We can utilize a to-do list in our home, workplace, or personal life.
